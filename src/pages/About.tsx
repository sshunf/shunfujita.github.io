                Hi! My name is Shun Fujita, an undergraduate student at Northwestern University, originally from Tokyo, Japan. 
                With a multicultural background shaped by international experiences, I bring a global perspective to problem-solving 
                and collaboration. I am particularly excited about computer systems and machine learning, and am actively exploring
                avenues to work on novel problems and drive impact.
